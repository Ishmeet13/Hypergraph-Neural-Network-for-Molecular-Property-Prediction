# Hypergraph-Neural-Network-for-Molecular-Property-Prediction
ðŸ§ª Implementation of two hypergraph neural networks for molecular property prediction: k-clique-based and functional group-oriented approaches. Both models capture higher-order molecular interactions for toxicity prediction, outperforming traditional GNNs. Tested on Tox21 NR-AR dataset with k-clique model achieving 0.894 ROC AUC. ðŸ§¬

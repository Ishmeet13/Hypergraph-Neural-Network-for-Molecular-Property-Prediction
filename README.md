# üß™ Hypergraph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction üß¨

This repository contains the implementation of two distinct hypergraph neural network approaches for molecular property prediction: a k-clique-based dense subgraph method and a functional group-oriented hypergraph construction technique. üî¨

## üìö Overview

Both models leverage hypergraph structures to capture higher-order molecular interactions essential for accurate toxicity prediction. üîç Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited to pairwise interactions, while our hypergraph approaches can model complex multi-atom interactions that are crucial for predicting molecular properties. üß†

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üî∑ K-Clique-Based Model
- Uses dense subgraphs (k-cliques) within molecular structures as hyperedges
- Represents molecules as a heterogeneous hypergraph with three distinct node types: atoms, functional groups, and cliques
- Utilizes heterogeneous message passing layers for information propagation across different node and edge types
- Implements global attention pooling to generate fixed-size representations for entire molecules

### üî∂ Functional Group-Oriented Model
- Constructs hyperedges using recognized functional groups, ring systems, and pharmacophore patterns
- Identifies 18 common functional groups and structural motifs using SMARTS pattern matching
- Extracts ring information to identify both aromatic and aliphatic rings
- Uses a bipartite representation to connect atoms with their respective hyperedges

## üìä Dataset

Both models were evaluated on the androgen receptor (NR-AR) pathway from the Tox21 dataset. The Tox21 dataset contains experimental activity data for approximately 10,000 compounds tested against the androgen receptor.

## üìà Performance

The k-clique-based model achieved an ROC AUC of 0.894, outperforming the functional group-oriented approach which attained 0.825 AUC. The k-clique model showed superior performance across all evaluation metrics, including PR AUC, accuracy, sensitivity/recall, and precision.

## üíª Usage

### üîÑ Data Preprocessing

```python
# Example of data preprocessing
from src.preprocessing import preprocess_tox21

# Preprocess the Tox21 NR-AR dataset
data = preprocess_tox21(target="NR-AR")
```

### K-Clique-Based Model

```python
# Example of using the k-clique-based model
from src.models import KCliqueHGNN
from src.hypergraph_construction import build_kclique_hypergraph

# Build a k-clique hypergraph from molecular data
hypergraph = build_kclique_hypergraph(molecule, k=3)

# Initialize and train the model
model = KCliqueHGNN()
model.train(train_data, val_data, epochs=100)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

### Functional Group-Oriented Model

```python
# Example of using the functional group-oriented model
from src.models import FunctionalGroupHGNN
from src.hypergraph_construction import build_fg_hypergraph

# Build a functional group hypergraph from molecular data
hypergraph = build_fg_hypergraph(molecule, num_patterns=18)

# Initialize and train the model
model = FunctionalGroupHGNN()
model.train(train_data, val_data, epochs=100)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

## üîç Findings

Our comparative analysis revealed that:

1. The method of hyperedge construction significantly impacts model effectiveness
2. The k-clique model better captures pharmacophore patterns and structural motifs relevant to receptor binding
3. The functional group-oriented approach offers computational advantages with a more straightforward implementation
4. The optimal clique size for the k-clique model was k=3, suggesting that triplet-based interactions capture an ideal level of molecular substructure

## üí™ Computational Requirements

The k-clique model requires more computational resources, particularly for preprocessing (k-clique detection), which takes 1.82x longer than the functional group model. The increased preprocessing cost stems from the computational complexity of k-clique detection, which scales exponentially with clique size in the worst case.

## üöÄ Future Directions

- Adaptive hyperedge construction that determines the appropriate clique size based on local molecular structure
- Learned hyperedge selection using attention mechanisms or graph neural networks
- Integration of 3D conformational information to capture spatial arrangements of atoms
- Multi-task learning to simultaneously predict activity across multiple related targets
